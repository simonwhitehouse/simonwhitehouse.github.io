            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date: May 23, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>BeforeCast ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use our BeforeCast app ("the App").</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Location Data</h4>
            <p>The App uses your device's location to provide weather, wind direction, air pressure, and moon phase data for your current or specified location. Location data is processed locally on your device and is only sent to Apple's WeatherKit API to fetch weather information. We do not store, share, or transmit your location data beyond this purpose.</p>

            <h4>1.2 Analytics and Crash Reporting</h4>
            <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics (provided by Google) to collect anonymous, non-personal data about how the App is used and to identify crashes or performance issues. This data includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version)</li>
                <li>App usage statistics (e.g., session duration, features used)</li>
                <li>Crash reports (e.g., error logs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or precise location) is collected or shared with Firebase.</p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide weather-related features based on your location via Apple's WeatherKit API.</li>
                <li>Improve the App’s performance and user experience through anonymized analytics.</li>
                <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues via Crashlytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except as described below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple's WeatherKit API</strong>: Location data is sent to Apple's WeatherKit API solely to retrieve weather data. This data is not stored by us or shared further.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong>: Anonymized analytics and crash data are shared with Firebase to improve the App. No personal information is included.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>Location data is processed locally on your device and not stored by the App. Analytics and crash data collected by Firebase are stored securely on Google's servers. We implement reasonable security measures to protect data, but no system is completely secure. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

            <h3>5. Your Choices</h3>
            <p>You can disable location services on your device to prevent the App from accessing your location; however, this may limit the App’s functionality. You can also opt out of analytics data collection via the App’s settings, where available, or through your device’s privacy settings.</p>

            <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it.</p>

            <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes via the App or by other means, such as email. The updated policy will be effective upon posting.</p>

            <h3>8. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [your-contact-email@example.com] or via the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> on our website.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This Privacy Policy is not a substitute for legal advice. We recommend consulting a lawyer to ensure compliance with applicable laws.</p>
